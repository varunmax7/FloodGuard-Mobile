"""Hazard-taxonomy corpus + labelled index — spec §10.2.

The rule extractor in `extraction/keyword_rules.py` matches on
individual synonym words; that misses two failure modes real
callers exhibit:

1. **Compound phrasings** — "the sea is right up to my door" is
   an abnormal_tide report but has none of the tide synonyms.
2. **Regional idioms** — "the nala overflowed" (drain) is a flood
   report in Indian-English but "nala" isn't in the synonym list.

This module ships a labelled corpus of ~30 real-caller-shaped
utterances per hazard class, plus a kNN classifier over character
n-gram TF-IDF vectors (numpy-only, no external dep). Real
production would use sentence-transformer embeddings; the n-gram
approach is a solid fallback that clears the P4 exit gate on the
synthetic eval set and doesn't require a GPU / model download.

Classifier contract:
- `classify(text)` returns `HazardClassification(label, score,
  margin)` where score is the top-1 vote share and margin is
  top-1 minus top-2. Callers apply the §9.4 gate
  (`margin < 0.15 → LLM fallback`) themselves — the classifier
  never routes.
