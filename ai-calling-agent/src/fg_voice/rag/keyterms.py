"""Static keyterm vocabulary for the STT (Deepgram Flux) — spec §9.3.

Keyterm prompting is the single highest-leverage accuracy knob on
telephony-quality speech. Deepgram Flux accepts a list of biasing
terms; when it sees an audio segment that could plausibly be one of
them, it's more likely to transcribe it correctly. This matters most
for:

- **Regional English + Indian accents** — "cyclone" and "sludge" are
  common domain terms callers use but rare in Deepgram's default
  training bias.
- **Domain-specific vocabulary** — "storm surge", "king tide", and
  "abnormal tide" don't appear in a general-English model's top-N
  weights.
- **Ambiguous phonetic pairs** — "flood" vs. "flute", "slick" vs.
  "sleek", etc.

This module ships the STATIC vocabulary (hazard + severity terms +
common misspellings + regional variants) that's known at deploy time.
The DYNAMIC gazetteer-based keyterm list (place names from the
resolved-district's neighbourhood, per §10.1) is a P4 concern and
lives in `rag/place_keyterms.py` when it lands.

**Import-layer note.** The layers contract in `.importlinter` places
`fg_voice.extraction | fg_voice.rag | fg_voice.persistence` at the
same tier — siblings that cannot import from each other. So the
canonical hazard/severity synonym maps in `extraction/normalize.py`
are duplicated here as PLAIN string lists rather than imported.

`tests/unit/test_keyterms.py` includes a consistency test that fails
if the two drift — the "one place to add a synonym" invariant is
preserved by the test suite, not by cross-imports.
