"""Post-call SMS pin-drop offer (spec §11 + §7.3 ladder attempt 4).

If a caller trailed off on location or hit the reprompt-ladder timeout,
we text them a link to a lightweight web form where they can drop a
map pin. The SMS + web-form pair let a caller finish a report they
couldn't complete on-call — the alternative is losing the report
entirely.

Trigger conditions (evaluated on `/voice/status` `completed`):
- The last CallState in Redis shows `current_node == TIMEOUT_EXIT`, OR
- The LOCATION slot is missing, OR its confidence is below the
  gazetteer accept threshold (spec §9.4 — 0.85 by default).

Suppression:
- Life-safety flag → suppressed. The caller was redirected to 112;
  an SMS with a report-form link is noise on top of an emergency.
- No `short_ref` yet → suppressed. Without a ref there's nothing for
  the web form to attach the caller's pin to. (This happens when
  the call ended before SUBMIT.)
- SMS globally disabled (`SMS_PIN_OFFER_ENABLED=false`) → suppressed.

Phone-number handling (CLAUDE.md invariant #6):
The raw MSISDN is NEVER persisted. It arrives in Twilio's
`/voice/status` webhook as `From=...` and is passed straight into
`SmsPinOfferService.maybe_send(to=...)` — the number lives in that
function's stack frame only, never on the CallState, never in the DB.

Sender failure handling:
`SmsSender.send()` failures are caught + logged. The webhook still
returns 204; a failed SMS should NEVER cause Twilio to retry the
status callback (which would double-submit the report to enrichment
via a re-fire path). The failure is auditable via the structured log
entry."""
